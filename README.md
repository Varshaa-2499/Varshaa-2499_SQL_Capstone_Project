# Varshaa-2499_SQL_Capstone_Project
This repository contains my SQL project based on - Hospital Management System analytics project that involved extracting insights from five core tables: doctor, patient, appointment, treatment, and billing.

## Hospital Management System – SQL Project
🔹 Project Overview

This project uses a Hospital Management System dataset to practice and demonstrate SQL skills such as database design, querying, and analysis. The dataset simulates real-world hospital operations, including patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and treatments.

The goal of this project is to create a relational database schema, run analytical queries, and generate meaningful insights that can support healthcare decision-making.

🔹 Objectives

Designed and structure hospital-related tables (patients, doctors, departments, appointments, billing, etc.).

SQL queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Answered key business/operational questions through SQL.

Demonstrated advanced SQL concepts like joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregations.

🔹 Key Queries & Use Cases

✔️ Retrieved the total revenue generated per hospital branch.

✔️ Identified the list of patients with their latest appointment date.

✔️ Average treatment cost per specialization.

✔️ Retrieved the most common reason for patients to visit.

✔️ Ranked top 3 doctors by highest appointment using RANK().


🔹 Tools & Skills Used

SQL (MySQL workbench)

Database Design – Tables, Keys, Normalization

Joins & Subqueries – INNER JOIN, CTE, Subquery

Aggregate Functions – COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING

Window Functions – RANK()

Data Cleaning & Integrity – Constraints, Primary & Foreign Keys

🔹 Insights Gained

Westside clinic has the highest revenue generated per hospital branch.

Checkups and consultaion is the most common reason to visit.

Dermertology department treatment cost is highes than other department.

Doctor who has more number of appointments than other doctors.

🔹 How to Use

Download the SQL scripts and dataset from this repository.

Import the dataset into your SQL environment (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite).

Run schema.sql to create tables and insert sample data.

Run queries.sql to execute business queries and generate insights.
