# Varshaa-2499_SQL_Capstone_Project
This repository contains my SQL project based on - Hospital Management System analytics project that involved extracting insights from five core tables: doctor, patient, appointment, treatment, and billing.

## Hospital Management System – SQL Project
🔹 Project Overview

This project uses a Hospital Management System dataset to practice and demonstrate SQL skills such as database design, querying, and analysis. The dataset simulates real-world hospital operations, including patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and treatments.

The goal of this project is to create a relational database schema, run analytical queries, and generate meaningful insights that can support healthcare decision-making.

🔹 Objectives

* Designed and structure hospital-related tables (patients, doctors, departments, appointments, billing, etc.).

* SQL queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

* Answered key business/operational questions through SQL.

* Demonstrated advanced SQL concepts like joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregations.

🔹 Key Queries & Use Cases

* Retrieved the total revenue generated per hospital branch.

* Identified the list of patients with their latest appointment date.

* Average treatment cost per specialization.

* Retrieved the most common reason for patients to visit.

* Ranked top 3 doctors by highest appointment using RANK().


🔹 Tools & Skills Used

SQL (MySQL workbench)

* Database Design – Tables, Keys, Normalization

* Joins & Subqueries – INNER JOIN, CTE, Subquery

* Aggregate Functions – COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING

* Window Functions – RANK()

* Data Cleaning & Integrity – Constraints, Primary & Foreign Keys

🔹 Insights Gained

* Westside clinic has the highest revenue generated per hospital branch.

* Checkups and consultaion is the most common reason to visit.

* Dermertology department treatment cost is highes than other department.

* Doctor's who has more number of appointments than other doctors.
